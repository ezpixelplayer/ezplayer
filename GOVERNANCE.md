# EZPlayer Project Governance

## Overview

EZPlayer is developed and maintained under the ezpixelplayer Organization.
Project decisions are guided by the **EZPlayer Steering Committee** (“the Committee”).

## Steering Committee

As of October 2025, the Committee consists of:

- @CaCtus491
- @merryoncherry
- @mjunek
- @pixelguy

The Committee may adjust membership by majority vote, documented in this file.

## Roles

- **Owners** – GitHub organization owners responsible for security, billing, and policy enforcement.
- **Maintainers** – Contributors with merge rights on specific repositories.
- **Contributors** – Anyone submitting pull requests or patches under the AGPLv3.

## Decision Making

- Technical and design decisions are made by consensus among maintainers.
- Policy or licensing decisions require a majority vote of the Steering Committee.
- The Steering Committee may offer **additional license terms** (e.g., commercial agreements)
  but cannot revoke or supersede the AGPLv3 license.

## Transparency and Notice

If the general licensing policy, contributor agreement, or any other key policy changes,
an announcement will be posted in this repository and on any official EZPlayer websites or forums.

## Security and Ownership

- All organization owners must use two-factor authentication with hardware security keys.
- At least two owner accounts must be controlled by separate individuals to ensure continuity.
- Addition or removal of an owner requires majority Committee approval or majority agreement among existing owners.
- Owners are to use separate credentials appropriate for performing maintainer or contributor operations.
