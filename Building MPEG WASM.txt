\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\etc\linuxFile.txt = /etc/linuxFile.txt
/mnt/c

Networking -- localhost works?
GUI -- works?

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential \
  autoconf \
  automake \
  libtool \
  pkg-config \
  git \
  curl \
  wget \
  unzip \
  cmake

OK, so checking out EMSDK in git windows breaks the newlines and it will not run... gotta use it in its own world.
  Seems like whatever build I do would have to be in WSL ... in its own world.

git pull

# Download and install the latest SDK tools.
Use of emsdk 4.0.7 is important

#./emsdk install latest
./emsdk install 4.0.7

# Make the "latest" SDK "active" for the current user. (writes .emscripten file)
#./emsdk activate latest
./emsdk activate 4.0.7

# Activate PATH and other environment variables in the current terminal
source ./emsdk_env.sh

Then:
npm run configure
npm run build

=========

Let's strip it down and clean it up

The only way to do it that is consistent is to use WSL on WSL's own disk using emsdk 4.0.7...
