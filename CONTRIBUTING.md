## Contribution Workflow

0. It may be a good idea to reach out to us to ask about interest in your contribution.  Someone may already have it in progress, have ideas about the implementation, etc., and we don't want you to waste your effort.
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Run tests and ensure code passes linting.
3. Submit a pull request targeting the `main` branch.
4. A maintainer will review and may request changes before merging.

All pull requests are understood to include your agreement to the above contributor terms.
